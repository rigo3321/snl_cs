## Introduction

Saturday Night Live (SNL) is a sketch comedy show the began to air in 1975 on the National Broadcast Company (NBC). Despite the half-century that the show has remained on air, it is still as relevant as ever--Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton, and Kamala Harris have been guests on the show during election years. In all its history, however, SNL has only had four Latinx cast members: Horatio Sanz (1998-2006), Fred Armisen (2002-2013), Melissa Villaseńor (2016-2022), and Marcello Hernández (2022-present). 

In his short tenure as a cast member, Marcello has brought noticeable changes to SNL; there has been an uptick in sketches where Spanish and code-switching play a major role. In this paper, I focus on two sketches "Protective Mom" and "Protective Mom 2", both written by Marcello. The premise for these two sketches is simple. Marcello brings his white girlfriend to meet his highly protectice Latina mom, in this case played by the Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal. The sequel shares the same concept as the first part, though here the character of Marcello's overprotectice aunt is introduced, played by the Puerto Rican reggaetón artist, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, better known by his stage name, Bad Bunny. In both sketches, there is some tension between Marcello's mom and aunt and the girlfriend, manifested by their critiques of the girlfriend's clothes, job, and whatever she brought to dinner. In the end, however, they manage to find a connection with the girlfriend when they find a shared interest--in the first sketch, the girlfriend wants to say grace; and in the second sketch, the girlfriend is concerned that Marcello is not eating enough.
